FAQ[](https://topdown-engine-docs.moremountains.com/faq.html#faq)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

### ⚠️ I downloaded the asset and it's not working / I don't have all the files ⚠️[](https://topdown-engine-docs.moremountains.com/faq.html#%EF%B8%8F-i-downloaded-the-asset-and-its-not-working--i-dont-have-all-the-files-%EF%B8%8F)

First, start by making sure you're running the **latest current version of Unity**. Then try downloading the asset again. Each version of the engine requires a specific Unity version, and if your version doesn't match, you'll get an old version. That's normal, that's how the Asset Store works. You can check what the requirements for each engine's version are on the [Releases](http://topdown-engine.moremountains.com/topdown-engine-releases) page.

### ⚠️ I get errors after importing the package / the camera doesn't move! ⚠️[](https://topdown-engine-docs.moremountains.com/faq.html#%EF%B8%8F-i-get-errors-after-importing-the-package--the-camera-doesnt-move-%EF%B8%8F)

This asset relies on a few Unity packages to function.

If you've imported the asset in a blank project, the Engine should automatically handle that for you, and install the required dependencies.

If despite that, you still get errors mentioning Cinemachine or PostProcessing, or if the camera doesn't follow the player, you can try to go to the Tools Menu at the top of your screen, then More Mountains, then Welcome To The TopDown Engine. That should fix it.

If that fails, make sure you imported at least v1.0.2 (you can check at the bottom of the readme what version you got) in an EMPTY project.

And if all that fails, please use the support email, I'll be happy to help you.

A bit of info about why this may happen : Unity allows (for now) an asset on the Asset Store to upload its Project Settings folder (which includes input, quality, etc), but not the Packages' manifest.json, which describes what packages the asset uses (such as, in this case, PostProcessing and Cincemachine). So the TopDown Engine implements an auto downloader that, once the asset's been imported, runs a check, downloads the packages, and makes sure everything works. Of course, this is not as robust as it could be if it was native to Unity. I'm working with Unity right now to change that, and have a native solution. In the meantime, please try the steps above if you run into issues.

### Is there a tutorial or something ?[](https://topdown-engine-docs.moremountains.com/faq.html#is-there-a-tutorial-or-something-)

Well you're reading the documentation right now, so it's a good start! There are also video tutorials [over on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl3caEhMYxQGFQ8LA5doTSkWhP2Mx84Gx). Furthermore, the asset includes a [complete documentation](https://topdown-engine-docs.moremountains.com/API/) of all the classes of the TopDown Engine. Plus, the code is heavily commented, so understanding it shouldn't be too hard.

### When will you release the update X or feature Y ?[](https://topdown-engine-docs.moremountains.com/faq.html#when-will-you-release-the-update-x-or-feature-y-)

I don't give ETAs. Updates get released when they're done and properly tested.

### Can you develop that feature that I really need ?[](https://topdown-engine-docs.moremountains.com/faq.html#can-you-develop-that-feature-that-i-really-need-)

**I don't take requests, paid or not**. You can of course express your interest in a new feature, but in the end I'm the one who decides what I do with the Engine. My goal is to create a strong yet generic basis for all kinds of top-down games. If your request is very specific (like a grappling hook or a portal gun - although I reckon that'd be pretty fun), it probably won't make it.

### What are the minimum prefabs I need to start a level from scratch ?[](https://topdown-engine-docs.moremountains.com/faq.html#what-are-the-minimum-prefabs-i-need-to-start-a-level-from-scratch-)

I get that one a lot actually, so I've included two "minimal demo" scenes in the assets. They contain, as the name implies, the only assets you need to get started.

### The asset is not working with my gamepad![](https://topdown-engine-docs.moremountains.com/faq.html#the-asset-is-not-working-with-my-gamepad)

Controls have been set up for keyboard and xbox pc gamepad. Obviously including support for every gamepad/configuration would be impossible, so I just went with the most common conf. Luckily for you, this has nothing to do with the TopDown Engine, and is really a **general Unity matter**. You should be able to find the right conf by googling it or on the Unity forums. Key binding is set up in the engine like in any other Unity project, via Edit > Project Settings > Input.

### The asset is crashing on my device![](https://topdown-engine-docs.moremountains.com/faq.html#the-asset-is-crashing-on-my-device)

My guess is it's a performance issue.

-   does it work in the editor ? If it works in the editor, your device may not be powerful enough to run it.

-   does the Minimal2D scene alone work on your tablet ? If it works, your device may not be powerful enough to run larger levels.

**This is a general Unity performance problem**, nothing really specific to the engine I'm afraid. If you absolutely want to run it on that device, aim for smaller assets, less enemies, stuff like that. Mesa1 level for example does include some very large assets (4096x4096 backgrounds for example), clearly not fit for slow devices. Oh and you may want to disable camera effects like blur or depth of field, they're not very mobile friendly.

### Where can I change the input settings ? I don't like pressing A to jump![](https://topdown-engine-docs.moremountains.com/faq.html#where-can-i-change-the-input-settings--i-dont-like-pressing-a-to-jump)

Like in any good Unity project, the settings are defined in the [Input Manager](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-InputManager.html). You can access it via Edit > Project Settings > Input.

### How can I add my own mobile controls, or the ones from that asset I bought ?[](https://topdown-engine-docs.moremountains.com/faq.html#how-can-i-add-my-own-mobile-controls-or-the-ones-from-that-asset-i-bought-)

If you look at the current mobile controls, you'll see that each button has its various events (button pressed, released, etc...) bound to methods in the InputManager class. As you'll see, this class is full of simple methods like Jump(), RunStart(), etc... It acts like a remote for your character. If you want to replace the mobile controls included in the asset with your own, you just have to remove these, and bind your new buttons/controls to these InputManager methods.

### What programming language is the asset written in ?[](https://topdown-engine-docs.moremountains.com/faq.html#what-programming-language-is-the-asset-written-in-)

C#

### Am I allowed to use the code in more than one project ? Can I modify the source code or the visual assets ?[](https://topdown-engine-docs.moremountains.com/faq.html#am-i-allowed-to-use-the-code-in-more-than-one-project--can-i-modify-the-source-code-or-the-visual-assets-)

Once you've bought the asset you can do **anything you want with the source code**, you're just **not allowed to redistribute it** (offer it for free, sell it anywhere, etc).

You can of course use that code to create commercial games and sell these, just **don't redistribute the contents of the asset**. And yes you can modify it, use it in more than one project. It's yours now!

### Can I just compile the asset and upload it without changing anything to Google Play, Steam Greenlight or the Apple Store ?[](https://topdown-engine-docs.moremountains.com/faq.html#can-i-just-compile-the-asset-and-upload-it-without-changing-anything-to-google-play-steam-greenlight-or-the-apple-store-)

Well no you can't. Although this sounds like a genius masterplan, I'm afraid it's not legal. Be imaginative, **create your own game**. Of course you can use the asset as a basis, that's what it's for.

### I really love the asset, is there any way I can help ?[](https://topdown-engine-docs.moremountains.com/faq.html#i-really-love-the-asset-is-there-any-way-i-can-help-)

Of course, [you could put a nice note or review on the asset on the Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/topdown-engine-89636?aid=1011lKhG).

### Who are you? What is More Mountains?[](https://topdown-engine-docs.moremountains.com/faq.html#who-are-you-what-is-more-mountains)

My name is Renaud Forestié, I'm a French game designer from Bordeaux. I also do [illustration](http://www.reuno.net/) work and **I'm available for freelance work**. I founded [More Mountains](http://www.moremountains.com/), my creative studio, in 2015, after 15 years spent as a freelance art director and game designer.

### Got another question ?[](https://topdown-engine-docs.moremountains.com/faq.html#got-another-question-)

Are you sure it's not answered above ? Then you can [join the discussion](https://forum.unity.com/threads/released-topdown-engine-by-more-mountains.566533/) on the Unity Forum thread, or send me a message using the [support email on the asset's page](https://topdown-engine.moremountains.com/topdown-engine-contact). Or you can use the form [on this page](https://topdown-engine.moremountains.com/topdown-engine-contact). It's up to you :)
